# Home-Price-Prediction
- This Dataset Is from Kaggle and it has prices of home which is in bengaluru accourding their ```location area```, ```#bath```, ```#bedroom```, ```#balcony``` etc. So basically it's ```Regression Problem``` Of ML for price prediction.
- I Trained this model with 3 diffrent algorithm named ```Linear Regression``` , ```Lasso```, and ```Decision Tree``` and test using ```Grid-Search CV``` for hyper-parameter training.
- Before training I have Done Some ```Data Cleaning``` and ```outlier removal``` that will increase our model accuracy.
